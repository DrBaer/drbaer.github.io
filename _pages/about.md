:wave: Hi, I'm Lars. I'm a computer scientist fascinated by how machine learning can solve real-world problems (though honestly in many cases a simple linear method is enough).

My educational background is in computational biology and chemistry, but I've spent my career developing various machine learning solutions â€” primarily for automated driving using point cloud data (atoms are also points, right?). This involved challenges like object detection, prediction, uncertainty estimation, and tracking. I also applied deep learning in the field of liquid biopsy, where I built a system for cell detection and tracking.

These days, I'm particularly drawn to generative models and geometric deep learning. This blog is where I explore these areas and share what I learn.
